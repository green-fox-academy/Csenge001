            <div>
                <p>I am fond of languages, I have studied hungarian literature and grammar at Eötvös Loránd University. Soon I have realised that programming is similar to my field of studies, as both professions build upon languages.</p>
                <p>I chose to become a developer because it delights me to create something from nothing, and I hope that my learning path would be a lifelong experience.</p>
